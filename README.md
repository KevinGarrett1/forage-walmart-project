Forage Walmart Project
This project was an incredible opportunity to dive into real-world data challenges, flex my skills, and show what I can bring to the table as a developer. From designing a database to scripting in Python, I built everything locally and made it happen.

✨ Project Highlights
Built from Scratch: Designed a database schema tailored to the project requirements.
Python Scripting: Wrote a script to extract, clean, and transform spreadsheet data for database insertion.
Thoroughly Tested: Verified each step to ensure the workflow was seamless and accurate.
📚 What I Did
Here’s how I approached the project:

Built the Database

Designed tables and relationships to structure the data effectively.
Used SQLite to create a schema that mirrored real-world data storage needs.
Wrote the Data Pipeline

Developed a Python script to handle:
Extracting rows from multiple spreadsheets.
Cleaning and transforming raw data.
Inserting formatted data into the database.
Tested and Debugged

Used test data to simulate real scenarios.
Debugged issues with schema mismatches and data inconsistencies.
🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated
Database Design
Created an efficient database schema from scratch, including:

Primary keys, relationships, and data types.
A structure that supports future scalability.
Data Manipulation
Extracted and transformed messy data from spreadsheets.
Cleaned inconsistencies and formatted data to fit schema requirements.
Python Development
Leveraged Python libraries like pandas for data processing.
Automated the pipeline to streamline data loading.
Problem-Solving
Overcame challenges like:

Handling messy, inconsistent spreadsheet data.
Testing and refining each step of the process.
🎯 Challenges I Overcame
Starting from Scratch: Designing a database schema with no pre-existing structure was a rewarding challenge.
Cleaning Messy Data: Real-world data isn’t perfect—I learned how to handle the unexpected and make it work.
Debugging Workflow Issues: Testing the pipeline taught me patience and attention to detail.
🛠️ How to Use This Project
Set Up the Database

Create the SQLite database using the provided schema.
Run the Python Script

Use the script to load and process spreadsheet data.
Verify the Results

Open the database to confirm that all data is stored correctly.
💡 What’s Next for Me
This project wasn’t just about completing a task—it was about leveling up. Now, I’m ready to tackle:

Larger and more complex data pipelines.
Exploring other database systems and technologies.
Applying what I’ve learned to real-world projects and challenges.
